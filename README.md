- Amateur (more like as a hobby) Python programmer
- My main project is [NotTheLast](https://github.com/Zdrapka/NotTheLast), a discord bot.
  - Really I'm doing this project as a way to teach myself 

<!---
Zdrapka/Zdrapka is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
